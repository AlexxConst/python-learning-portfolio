# Python Learning Portfolio

This repository contains my collection of small Python learning projects.  
Each project focuses on a specific concept: loops, functions, modules, OOP, Turtle graphics, and more.

These projects were created while studying Python on my path toward becoming a backend developer / DevOps engineer.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder contains:
- `main.py` — the project source code  
- `README.md` — short description of what the project does and what was learned

Example structure:
project-name/
├── main.py
└── README.md

## 📚 Projects Included

- 🎨 Hirst Dot Painting — Turtle graphics, loops, modulo
- 🧮 Calculator - With operators and cli
  
More projects will be added as I continue learning.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository shows:
- my progress as a Python developer  
- understanding of programming fundamentals  
- consistency and practice  

I use it to track my learning journey and improve step by step.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies

- Python 3
- Turtle module
- Random module
- Basic algorithms
- Git & GitHub

## 📈 Future Plans

- Add Flask mini-projects
