# Hirst Dot Painting (Python Turtle)

This project is a recreation of Damien Hirst–style dot paintings using Python's `turtle` module.  
The program draws a 10×10 grid of colorful dots, each with a randomly chosen color from a predefined palette.

## 🎨 Features
- Generates a 100-dot painting arranged in a 10×10 grid
- Uses `turtle` graphics to draw filled circles (“dots”)
- Each dot receives a random color from a color palette
- Simple, clean implementation suitable for beginners learning loops and graphics

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Working with the `turtle` graphics module
- Using loops to generate patterns
- Understanding `%` (modulo) to detect every *n*-th iteration
- Controlling movement and directions of the turtle

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the script as `main.py`.
3. Run:

```bash
python3 main.py
